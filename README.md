# Daily C++ Practice

This repository contains my daily C++ problem-solving code.  
Most problems are solved from Codeforces, LeetCode, or custom exercises.

## 🎯 Goals
- Improve algorithmic thinking
- Build C++ fluency
- Stay consistent with daily practice

## 📁 Structure
Each folder represents a day (Day1, Day2, etc.) and contains:
- The problem solution in C++
- (Optional) problem description or notes

## 🛠️ Example
```
/Day1/
  - problem.cpp
/Day2/
  - problem.cpp
```

## 🚀 Let's Code!
